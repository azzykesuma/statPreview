## Overview
the idea is to make a resposive website for mobile and desktop. 
### The challenge
the challenge lies within positioning div when the screen resolution changes. i have to use the media querries + row reverse to position the image. however, the card info is centered manually using margin, and this is subpar solution. there has to be a better way to center the info div within the card.
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### What I learned

the media querry is quite complex, you need to adjust your style according to the width, and sometimes it is a bit messy. this project requires me to add the min width of 1440px 
for the desktop style to be in effect, but even my screen resolution is below that. the preview in my screen is messed up.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
